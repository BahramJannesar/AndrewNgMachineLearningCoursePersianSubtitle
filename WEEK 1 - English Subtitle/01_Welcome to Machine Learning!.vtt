00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.740
What is machine learning?

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.090
You probably use it dozens of times
a day without even knowing it.

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.790
Each time you do a web search on Google or
Bing, that works so well

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.340
because their machine learning software
has figured out how to rank what pages.

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.230
When Facebook or Apple's photo application
recognizes your friends in your pictures,

6
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.850
that's also machine learning.

7
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.370
Each time you read your email and

8
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.490
a spam filter saves you from having
to wade through tons of spam, again,

9
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.390
that's because your computer has learned
to distinguish spam from non-spam email.

10
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.240
So, that's machine learning.

11
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.260
There's a science of getting computers to
learn without being explicitly programmed.

12
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.660
One of the research projects that I'm
working on is getting robots to tidy

13
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.780
up the house.

14
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.010
How do you go about doing that?

15
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.860
Well what you can do is have the robot
watch you demonstrate the task and

16
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.000
learn from that.

17
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.690
The robot can then watch what objects
you pick up and where to put them and

18
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.000
try to do the same thing
even when you aren't there.

19
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.460
For me, one of the reasons I'm
excited about this is the AI, or

20
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.530
artificial intelligence problem.

21
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.209
Building truly intelligent machines,

22
00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:01.680
we can do just about anything that you or
I can do.

23
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.920
Many scientists think the best way to
make progress on this is through learning

24
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.630
algorithms called neural networks,
which mimic how the human brain works, and

25
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.030
I'll teach you about that, too.

26
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.170
In this class,
you learn about machine learning and

27
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.390
get to implement them yourself.

28
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.920
