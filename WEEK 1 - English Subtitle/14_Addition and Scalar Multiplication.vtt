00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.612
In this video we'll talk about

2
00:00:01.612 --> 00:00:03.503
matrix addition and subtraction,

3
00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:04.950
as well as how to

4
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.582
multiply a matrix by a

5
00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:09.292
number, also called Scalar Multiplication.

6
00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:11.825
Let's start an example.

7
00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:14.725
Given two matrices like these,

8
00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:16.735
let's say I want to add them together.

9
00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:18.038
How do I do that?

10
00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:20.538
And so, what does addition of matrices mean?

11
00:00:20.538 --> 00:00:21.632
It turns out that if you

12
00:00:21.632 --> 00:00:24.312
want to add two matrices, what

13
00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:25.762
you do is you just add

14
00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:28.076
up the elements of these matrices one at a time.

15
00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:30.363
So, my result of adding

16
00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:31.480
two matrices is going to

17
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.415
be itself another matrix and

18
00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:34.972
the first element again just by

19
00:00:34.972 --> 00:00:36.732
taking one and four and

20
00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:39.470
multiplying them and adding them together, so I get five.

21
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.578
The second element I get

22
00:00:41.578 --> 00:00:43.092
by taking two and two

23
00:00:43.092 --> 00:00:44.169
and adding them, so I get

24
00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:47.240
four; three plus three

25
00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:49.568
plus zero is three, and so on.

26
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.442
I'm going to stop changing colors, I guess.

27
00:00:51.442 --> 00:00:52.768
And, on the right is open

28
00:00:52.768 --> 00:00:54.820
five, ten and two.

29
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.182
And it turns out you can

30
00:00:57.182 --> 00:01:00.408
add only two matrices that are of the same dimensions.

31
00:01:00.408 --> 00:01:02.789
So this example is

32
00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.595
a three by two matrix,

33
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.029
because this has 3

34
00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:11.917
rows and 2 columns, so it's 3 by 2.

35
00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:13.451
This is also a 3

36
00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:15.113
by 2 matrix, and the

37
00:01:15.113 --> 00:01:16.202
result of adding these two

38
00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:19.415
matrices is a 3 by 2 matrix again.

39
00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:20.468
So you can only add

40
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.837
matrices of the same

41
00:01:21.837 --> 00:01:23.533
dimension, and the result

42
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.959
will be another matrix that's of

43
00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:28.057
the same dimension as the ones you just added.

44
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.785
Where as in contrast, if you

45
00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:31.803
were to take these two matrices, so this

46
00:01:31.803 --> 00:01:32.894
one is a 3 by

47
00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:36.208
2 matrix, okay, 3 rows, 2 columns.

48
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.659
This here is a 2 by 2 matrix.

49
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.190
And because these two matrices

50
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.837
are not of the same dimension,

51
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.635
you know, this is an error,

52
00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:46.400
so you cannot add these

53
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.508
two matrices and, you know,

54
00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:52.184
their sum is not well-defined.

55
00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:54.561
So that's matrix addition.

56
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:58.382
Next, let's talk about multiplying matrices by a scalar number.

57
00:01:58.382 --> 00:02:00.069
And the scalar is just a,

58
00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.028
maybe a overly fancy term for,

59
00:02:02.028 --> 00:02:04.342
you know, a number or a real number.

60
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.075
Alright, this means real number.

61
00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:10.280
So let's take the number 3 and multiply it by this matrix.

62
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.182
And if you do that, the result is pretty much what you'll expect.

63
00:02:13.182 --> 00:02:14.926
You just take your elements

64
00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.184
of the matrix and multiply

65
00:02:16.184 --> 00:02:18.114
them by 3, one at a time.

66
00:02:18.114 --> 00:02:19.428
So, you know, one

67
00:02:19.428 --> 00:02:21.708
times three is three.

68
00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:24.011
What, two times three is

69
00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:25.988
six, 3 times 3

70
00:02:25.988 --> 00:02:28.181
is 9, and let's see, I'm

71
00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:30.152
going to stop changing colors again.

72
00:02:30.157 --> 00:02:31.654
Zero times 3 is zero.

73
00:02:31.654 --> 00:02:35.992
Three times 5 is 15, and 3 times 1 is three.

74
00:02:35.992 --> 00:02:37.849
And so this matrix is the

75
00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.702
result of multiplying that matrix on the left by 3.

76
00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.173
And you notice, again,

77
00:02:42.173 --> 00:02:43.443
this is a 3 by 2

78
00:02:43.443 --> 00:02:44.903
matrix and the result is

79
00:02:44.903 --> 00:02:47.505
a matrix of the same dimension.

80
00:02:47.505 --> 00:02:48.634
This is a 3 by

81
00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:49.920
2, both of these are

82
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.607
3 by 2 dimensional matrices.

83
00:02:52.634 --> 00:02:54.334
And by the way,

84
00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:57.050
you can write multiplication, you know, either way.

85
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.491
So, I have three times this matrix.

86
00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:01.468
I could also have written this

87
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.256
matrix and 0, 2, 5, 3, 1, right.

88
00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:07.672
I just copied this matrix over to the right.

89
00:03:07.672 --> 00:03:11.228
I can also take this matrix and multiply this by three.

90
00:03:11.228 --> 00:03:12.040
So whether it's you know, 3

91
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.388
times the matrix or the

92
00:03:13.388 --> 00:03:14.983
matrix times three is

93
00:03:14.983 --> 00:03:18.771
the same thing and this thing here in the middle is the result.

94
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.869
You can also take a matrix and divide it by a number.

95
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.275
So, turns out taking

96
00:03:24.275 --> 00:03:25.716
this matrix and dividing it by

97
00:03:25.716 --> 00:03:27.140
four, this is actually the

98
00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:29.055
same as taking the number

99
00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:32.819
one quarter, and multiplying it by this matrix.

100
00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.318
4, 0, 6, 3 and

101
00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:36.803
so, you can figure

102
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.593
the answer, the result of

103
00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.365
this product is, one quarter

104
00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:43.274
times four is one, one quarter times zero is zero.

105
00:03:43.282 --> 00:03:46.570
One quarter times six is,

106
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.353
what, three halves, about six over

107
00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:50.369
four is three halves, and

108
00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:53.862
one quarter times three is three quarters.

109
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.880
And so that's the results

110
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.207
of computing this matrix divided by four.

111
00:03:59.207 --> 00:04:01.677
Vectors give you the result.

112
00:04:01.697 --> 00:04:03.805
Finally, for a slightly

113
00:04:03.805 --> 00:04:05.714
more complicated example, you can

114
00:04:05.714 --> 00:04:09.460
also take these operations and combine them together.

115
00:04:09.513 --> 00:04:11.448
So in this calculation, I

116
00:04:11.448 --> 00:04:12.801
have three times a vector

117
00:04:12.801 --> 00:04:16.370
plus a vector minus another vector divided by three.

118
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.344
So just make sure we know where these are, right.

119
00:04:18.344 --> 00:04:20.031
This multiplication.

120
00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:23.648
This is an example of

121
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.986
scalar multiplication because I am taking three and multiplying it.

122
00:04:27.986 --> 00:04:30.240
And this is, you know, another

123
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.067
scalar multiplication.

124
00:04:32.067 --> 00:04:34.182
Or more like scalar division, I guess.

125
00:04:34.182 --> 00:04:36.503
It really just means one zero times this.

126
00:04:36.503 --> 00:04:39.445
And so if we evaluate

127
00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.044
these two operations first, then

128
00:04:43.044 --> 00:04:44.612
what we get is this thing

129
00:04:44.612 --> 00:04:47.127
is equal to, let's see,

130
00:04:47.127 --> 00:04:49.902
so three times that vector is three,

131
00:04:49.912 --> 00:04:53.200
twelve, six, plus

132
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.088
my vector in the middle which

133
00:04:55.088 --> 00:04:58.552
is a 005 minus

134
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.733
one, zero, two-thirds, right?

135
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.318
And again, just to make

136
00:05:05.318 --> 00:05:07.064
sure we understand what is going on here,

137
00:05:07.064 --> 00:05:11.504
this plus symbol, that is

138
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.690
matrix addition, right?

139
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.973
I really, since these are

140
00:05:16.973 --> 00:05:20.204
vectors, remember, vectors are special cases of matrices, right?

141
00:05:20.204 --> 00:05:21.538
This, you can also call

142
00:05:21.538 --> 00:05:25.106
this vector addition This

143
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.148
minus sign here, this is

144
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.162
again a matrix subtraction,

145
00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:32.249
but because this is an

146
00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:33.432
n by 1, really a three

147
00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:35.547
by one matrix, that this

148
00:05:35.547 --> 00:05:36.494
is actually a vector, so this is

149
00:05:36.494 --> 00:05:39.822
also vector, this column.

150
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.677
We call this matrix a vector subtraction, as well.

151
00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:44.392
OK?

152
00:05:44.392 --> 00:05:46.073
And finally to wrap this up.

153
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.103
This therefore gives me a

154
00:05:48.118 --> 00:05:49.952
vector, whose first element is

155
00:05:49.952 --> 00:05:53.632
going to be 3+0-1,

156
00:05:53.632 --> 00:05:56.150
so that's 3-1, which is 2.

157
00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.204
The second element is 12+0-0, which is 12.

158
00:06:01.214 --> 00:06:03.970
And the third element

159
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.222
of this is, what, 6+5-(2/3),

160
00:06:07.222 --> 00:06:10.678
which is 11-(2/3), so

161
00:06:10.678 --> 00:06:14.021
that's 10 and one-third

162
00:06:14.021 --> 00:06:16.029
and see, you close this square bracket.

163
00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:17.983
And so this gives me a

164
00:06:17.983 --> 00:06:21.671
3 by 1 matrix, which is

165
00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:23.901
also just called a 3

166
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:29.005
dimensional vector, which

167
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.847
is the outcome of this calculation over here.

168
00:06:32.847 --> 00:06:34.984
So that's how you

169
00:06:34.984 --> 00:06:36.698
add and subtract matrices and

170
00:06:36.698 --> 00:06:41.488
vectors and multiply them by scalars or by row numbers.

171
00:06:41.488 --> 00:06:42.767
So far I have only talked

172
00:06:42.767 --> 00:06:44.718
about how to multiply matrices and

173
00:06:44.718 --> 00:06:46.994
vectors by scalars, by row numbers.

174
00:06:46.994 --> 00:06:48.128
In the next video we will

175
00:06:48.128 --> 00:06:49.418
talk about a much more

176
00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:51.035
interesting step, of taking

177
00:06:51.035 --> 00:06:54.112
2 matrices and multiplying 2 matrices together.
