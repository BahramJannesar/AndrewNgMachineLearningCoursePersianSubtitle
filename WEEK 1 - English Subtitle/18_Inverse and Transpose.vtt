00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.540
In this video, I want to

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.885
tell you about a couple of special

3
00:00:02.885 --> 00:00:04.848
matrix operations, called the

4
00:00:04.848 --> 00:00:07.430
matrix inverse and the matrix transpose operation.

5
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.312
Let's start by talking about matrix

6
00:00:10.312 --> 00:00:12.928
inverse, and as

7
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.516
usual we'll start by thinking about

8
00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:17.248
how it relates to real numbers.

9
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.803
In the last video, I said

10
00:00:18.803 --> 00:00:20.625
that the number one plays the

11
00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:24.570
role of the identity in

12
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.059
the space of real numbers because

13
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.851
one times anything is equal to itself.

14
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.270
It turns out that real numbers

15
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.642
have this property that very

16
00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:33.093
number have an, that

17
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.635
each number has an inverse,

18
00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.637
for example, given the number

19
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.552
three, there exists some

20
00:00:38.552 --> 00:00:40.132
number, which happens to

21
00:00:40.132 --> 00:00:41.544
be three inverse so that

22
00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:43.798
that number times gives you

23
00:00:43.798 --> 00:00:46.458
back the identity element one.

24
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.727
And so to me, inverse of course this is just one third.

25
00:00:50.727 --> 00:00:53.236
And given some other number,

26
00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:55.360
maybe twelve there is

27
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.312
some number which is the

28
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.464
inverse of twelve written as

29
00:00:59.464 --> 00:01:01.600
twelve to the minus one, or

30
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.582
really this is just one twelve.

31
00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:07.092
So that when you multiply these two things together.

32
00:01:07.092 --> 00:01:09.292
the product is equal to

33
00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:12.367
the identity element one again.

34
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.838
Now it turns out that in

35
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.154
the space of real numbers, not everything has an inverse.

36
00:01:17.154 --> 00:01:19.148
For example the number zero

37
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.981
does not have an inverse, right?

38
00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:25.410
Because zero's a zero inverse, one over zero that's undefined.

39
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.862
Like this one over zero is not well defined.

40
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.419
And what we want to

41
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.453
do, in the rest of this

42
00:01:32.453 --> 00:01:33.835
slide, is figure out what does

43
00:01:33.835 --> 00:01:38.341
it mean to compute the inverse of a matrix.

44
00:01:39.253 --> 00:01:41.718
Here's the idea: If

45
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.198
A is a n by

46
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.078
n matrix, and it

47
00:01:45.078 --> 00:01:46.320
has an inverse, I will say

48
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.487
a bit more about that later, then

49
00:01:48.487 --> 00:01:49.927
the inverse is going to

50
00:01:49.927 --> 00:01:51.668
be written A to the

51
00:01:51.668 --> 00:01:54.186
minus one and A

52
00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:55.798
times this inverse, A to

53
00:01:55.798 --> 00:01:57.045
the minus one, is going to

54
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.395
equal to A inverse times

55
00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:00.741
A, is going to

56
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:04.088
give us back the identity matrix.

57
00:02:04.088 --> 00:02:04.958
Okay?

58
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.037
Only matrices that are

59
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.848
m by m for some the idea of M having inverse.

60
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.692
So, a matrix is

61
00:02:11.692 --> 00:02:13.010
M by M, this is also

62
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.055
called a square matrix and

63
00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:18.222
it's called square because

64
00:02:18.222 --> 00:02:24.852
the number of rows is equal to the number of columns.

65
00:02:24.852 --> 00:02:26.516
Right and it turns out

66
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.518
only square matrices have inverses,

67
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.148
so A is a square

68
00:02:31.148 --> 00:02:32.973
matrix, is m by m,

69
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.198
on inverse this equation over here.

70
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.568
Let's look at a concrete example,

71
00:02:39.568 --> 00:02:41.530
so let's say I

72
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.090
have a matrix, three, four,

73
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.080
two, sixteen.

74
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.535
So this is a two by

75
00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:51.788
two matrix, so it's

76
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.159
a square matrix and so this

77
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.442
may just could have an and

78
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.733
it turns out that I

79
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.308
happen to know the inverse

80
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.810
of this matrix is zero point

81
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.675
four, minus zero point

82
00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:04.485
one, minus zero point

83
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.687
zero five, zero zero seven five.

84
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.267
And if I take this matrix

85
00:03:10.267 --> 00:03:12.273
and multiply these together it

86
00:03:12.273 --> 00:03:13.598
turns out what I get

87
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.595
is the two by

88
00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:18.324
two identity matrix, I,

89
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.542
this is I two by two.

90
00:03:20.558 --> 00:03:21.365
Okay?

91
00:03:21.365 --> 00:03:22.308
And so on this slide,

92
00:03:22.308 --> 00:03:24.416
you know this matrix is

93
00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:27.199
the matrix A, and this matrix is the matrix A-inverse.

94
00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:28.622
And it turns out

95
00:03:28.622 --> 00:03:29.835
if that you are computing A

96
00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:31.385
times A-inverse, it turns out

97
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.742
if you compute A-inverse times

98
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.821
A you also get back the identity matrix.

99
00:03:36.852 --> 00:03:38.640
So how did I

100
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.760
find this inverse or how

101
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.698
did I come up with this inverse over here?

102
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.048
It turns out that sometimes

103
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.731
you can compute inverses by hand

104
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.745
but almost no one does that these days.

105
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.888
And it turns out there is

106
00:03:49.888 --> 00:03:52.198
very good numerical software for

107
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.447
taking a matrix and computing its inverse.

108
00:03:55.447 --> 00:03:56.369
So again, this is one of

109
00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:57.310
those things where there are lots

110
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.450
of open source libraries that

111
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.748
you can link to from any

112
00:04:00.748 --> 00:04:04.973
of the popular programming languages to compute inverses of matrices.

113
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.892
Let me show you a quick example.

114
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.935
How I actually computed this inverse,

115
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.132
and what I did was I used software called Optive.

116
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.437
So let me bring that up.

117
00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:17.186
We will see a lot about Optive later.

118
00:04:17.186 --> 00:04:18.903
Let me just quickly show you an example.

119
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.078
Set my matrix A to

120
00:04:21.078 --> 00:04:22.274
be equal to that matrix on

121
00:04:22.274 --> 00:04:24.456
the left, type three four

122
00:04:24.456 --> 00:04:28.080
two sixteen, so that's my matrix A right.

123
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.882
This is matrix 34,

124
00:04:29.882 --> 00:04:31.141
216 that I have down

125
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.773
here on the left.

126
00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:34.543
And, the software lets me compute

127
00:04:34.543 --> 00:04:36.243
the inverse of A very easily.

128
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.110
It's like P over A equals this.

129
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.765
And so, this is right,

130
00:04:40.765 --> 00:04:41.935
this matrix here on my

131
00:04:41.935 --> 00:04:43.715
four minus, on my one, and so on.

132
00:04:43.715 --> 00:04:45.308
This given the numerical

133
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.794
solution to what is the

134
00:04:46.794 --> 00:04:48.350
inverse of A. So let me

135
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.538
just write, inverse of A

136
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.558
equals P inverse of

137
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.232
A over that I

138
00:04:55.232 --> 00:04:57.200
can now just verify that A

139
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.597
times A inverse the identity

140
00:04:58.597 --> 00:05:00.644
is, type A times the

141
00:05:00.644 --> 00:05:03.390
inverse of A and

142
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.740
the result of that is

143
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.513
this matrix and this is

144
00:05:06.513 --> 00:05:08.708
one one on the diagonal

145
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.453
and essentially ten to

146
00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:11.582
the minus seventeen, ten to the

147
00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:13.324
minus sixteen, so Up to

148
00:05:13.324 --> 00:05:14.961
numerical precision, up to

149
00:05:14.961 --> 00:05:16.012
a little bit of round off

150
00:05:16.012 --> 00:05:17.562
error that my computer

151
00:05:17.562 --> 00:05:21.123
had in finding optimal matrices

152
00:05:21.123 --> 00:05:22.623
and these numbers off the

153
00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:24.948
diagonals are essentially zero

154
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.078
so A times the inverse is essentially the identity matrix.

155
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.907
Can also verify the inverse of

156
00:05:30.907 --> 00:05:33.215
A times A is also

157
00:05:33.215 --> 00:05:35.795
equal to the identity,

158
00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:38.183
ones on the diagonals and values

159
00:05:38.183 --> 00:05:39.938
that are essentially zero except

160
00:05:39.938 --> 00:05:40.856
for a little bit of round

161
00:05:40.856 --> 00:05:44.752
dot error on the off diagonals.

162
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.428
If a definition that the inverse

163
00:05:47.428 --> 00:05:48.636
of a matrix is, I had

164
00:05:48.636 --> 00:05:50.333
this caveat first it must

165
00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:52.367
always be a square matrix, it

166
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.219
had this caveat, that if

167
00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.237
A has an inverse, exactly what

168
00:05:57.237 --> 00:05:58.855
matrices have an inverse

169
00:05:58.855 --> 00:06:00.176
is beyond the scope of this

170
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.056
linear algebra for review that one

171
00:06:02.056 --> 00:06:03.942
intuition you might take away

172
00:06:03.942 --> 00:06:05.245
that just as the

173
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.588
number zero doesn't have an

174
00:06:06.588 --> 00:06:08.429
inverse, it turns out

175
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.188
that if A is say the

176
00:06:10.188 --> 00:06:13.457
matrix of all zeros, then

177
00:06:13.457 --> 00:06:14.791
this matrix A also does

178
00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.432
not have an inverse because there's

179
00:06:16.432 --> 00:06:18.033
no matrix there's no A

180
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.821
inverse matrix so that this

181
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:21.174
matrix times some other

182
00:06:21.174 --> 00:06:22.225
matrix will give you the

183
00:06:22.225 --> 00:06:23.778
identity matrix so this matrix of

184
00:06:23.778 --> 00:06:25.322
all zeros, and there

185
00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:27.660
are a few other matrices with properties similar to this.

186
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.843
That also don't have an inverse.

187
00:06:30.843 --> 00:06:32.492
But it turns out that

188
00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:33.600
in this review I don't

189
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.436
want to go too deeply into what

190
00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:37.108
it means matrix have an

191
00:06:37.108 --> 00:06:38.765
inverse but it turns

192
00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:40.006
out for our machine learning

193
00:06:40.006 --> 00:06:41.807
application this shouldn't be

194
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.260
an issue or more precisely

195
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.389
for the learning algorithms where

196
00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:47.943
this may be an to namely

197
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.252
whether or not an inverse matrix

198
00:06:49.252 --> 00:06:50.968
appears and I will tell when

199
00:06:50.968 --> 00:06:51.952
we get to those learning algorithms

200
00:06:51.952 --> 00:06:53.690
just what it means for an

201
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.850
algorithm to have or not

202
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.572
have an inverse and how to fix it in case.

203
00:06:56.572 --> 00:06:59.200
Working with matrices that don't

204
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.458
have inverses.

205
00:07:00.458 --> 00:07:02.680
But the intuition if you

206
00:07:02.711 --> 00:07:04.275
want is that you can

207
00:07:04.275 --> 00:07:05.808
think of matrices as not

208
00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:07.242
have an inverse that is somehow

209
00:07:07.242 --> 00:07:10.331
too close to zero in some sense.

210
00:07:10.353 --> 00:07:12.602
So, just to wrap

211
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.900
up the terminology, matrix that

212
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.938
don't have an inverse Sometimes called

213
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.835
a singular matrix or degenerate

214
00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:20.960
matrix and so this

215
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.560
matrix over here is an

216
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.701
example zero zero zero matrix.

217
00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:29.491
is an example of a matrix that is singular, or a matrix that is degenerate.

218
00:07:29.537 --> 00:07:31.348
Finally, the last special

219
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.652
matrix operation I want to

220
00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.520
tell you about is to do matrix transpose.

221
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.369
So suppose I have

222
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.160
matrix A, if I compute

223
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.220
the transpose of A, that's what I get here on the right.

224
00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:43.156
This is a transpose which is

225
00:07:43.156 --> 00:07:46.275
written and A superscript T,

226
00:07:46.278 --> 00:07:47.363
and the way you compute

227
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.531
the transpose of a matrix is as follows.

228
00:07:49.531 --> 00:07:50.628
To get a transpose I am going

229
00:07:50.628 --> 00:07:52.276
to first take the first

230
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.079
row of A one to zero.

231
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.791
That becomes this first column of this transpose.

232
00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.762
And then I'm going to take

233
00:07:59.762 --> 00:08:01.050
the second row of A,

234
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.610
3 5 9, and that becomes the second column.

235
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.838
of the matrix A transpose.

236
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.131
And another way of

237
00:08:08.131 --> 00:08:10.296
thinking about how the computer transposes

238
00:08:10.296 --> 00:08:11.569
is as if you're taking this

239
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.671
sort of 45 degree axis

240
00:08:14.671 --> 00:08:16.349
and you are mirroring or you

241
00:08:16.349 --> 00:08:21.698
are flipping the matrix along that 45 degree axis.

242
00:08:21.698 --> 00:08:23.488
so here's the more formal

243
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.522
definition of a matrix transpose.

244
00:08:26.522 --> 00:08:30.688
Let's say A is a m by n matrix.

245
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.727
And let's let B equal A

246
00:08:32.727 --> 00:08:36.371
transpose and so BA transpose like so.

247
00:08:36.386 --> 00:08:37.563
Then B is going to

248
00:08:37.563 --> 00:08:39.637
be a n by m matrix

249
00:08:39.637 --> 00:08:42.752
with the dimensions reversed so

250
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.308
here we have a 2x3 matrix.

251
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.050
And so the transpose becomes a

252
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.196
3x2 matrix, and moreover,

253
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.585
the BIJ is equal to AJI.

254
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.030
So the IJ element of this

255
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.390
matrix B is going to be

256
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.913
the JI element of that

257
00:08:59.913 --> 00:09:02.310
earlier matrix A. So for

258
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.212
example, B 1 2

259
00:09:04.212 --> 00:09:06.997
is going to be equal

260
00:09:06.997 --> 00:09:08.756
to, look at this

261
00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:10.537
matrix, B 1 2 is going to be equal to

262
00:09:10.537 --> 00:09:13.775
this element 3 1st row, 2nd column.

263
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.008
And that equal to this, which

264
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.199
is a two one, second

265
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.412
row first column, right, which

266
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.421
is equal to two and some
[It should be 3]

267
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.860
of the example B 3

268
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.561
2, right, that's B

269
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:30.922
3 2 is this element 9,

270
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.282
and that's equal to

271
00:09:33.282 --> 00:09:35.525
a two three which is

272
00:09:35.525 --> 00:09:38.963
this element up here, nine.

273
00:09:38.963 --> 00:09:40.433
And so that wraps up

274
00:09:40.433 --> 00:09:41.893
the definition of what it

275
00:09:41.893 --> 00:09:43.468
means to take the transpose

276
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.991
of a matrix and that

277
00:09:44.991 --> 00:09:49.323
in fact concludes our linear algebra review.

278
00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:50.754
So by now hopefully you know

279
00:09:50.754 --> 00:09:52.205
how to add and subtract

280
00:09:52.205 --> 00:09:53.701
matrices as well as

281
00:09:53.701 --> 00:09:55.325
multiply them and you

282
00:09:55.325 --> 00:09:57.185
also know how, what are

283
00:09:57.185 --> 00:09:58.942
the definitions of the inverses

284
00:09:58.942 --> 00:10:01.457
and transposes of a matrix

285
00:10:01.457 --> 00:10:02.934
and these are the main operations

286
00:10:02.934 --> 00:10:05.152
used in linear algebra

287
00:10:05.152 --> 00:10:06.172
for this course.

288
00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:09.043
In case this is the first time you are seeing this material.

289
00:10:09.043 --> 00:10:10.798
I know this was a lot

290
00:10:10.798 --> 00:10:13.032
of linear algebra material all presented

291
00:10:13.032 --> 00:10:14.512
very quickly and it's a

292
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.581
lot to absorb but

293
00:10:16.581 --> 00:10:18.102
if you there's no need

294
00:10:18.102 --> 00:10:20.045
to memorize all the definitions

295
00:10:20.045 --> 00:10:21.718
we just went through and if

296
00:10:21.718 --> 00:10:23.451
you download the copy of either

297
00:10:23.451 --> 00:10:24.520
these slides or of the

298
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.353
lecture notes from the course website.

299
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.645
and use either the slides or

300
00:10:29.645 --> 00:10:31.478
the lecture notes as a reference

301
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.886
then you can always refer back

302
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.178
to the definitions and to figure

303
00:10:34.178 --> 00:10:35.615
out what are these matrix

304
00:10:35.615 --> 00:10:39.111
multiplications, transposes and so on definitions.

305
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.697
And the lecture notes on the course website also

306
00:10:40.697 --> 00:10:42.421
has pointers to additional

307
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.675
resources linear algebra which

308
00:10:44.675 --> 00:10:47.445
you can use to learn more about linear algebra by yourself.

309
00:10:48.861 --> 00:10:53.445
And next with these new tools.

310
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.153
We'll be able in the next

311
00:10:55.153 --> 00:10:57.035
few videos to develop more powerful

312
00:10:57.035 --> 00:10:58.758
forms of linear regression that

313
00:10:58.758 --> 00:10:59.854
can view of a lot

314
00:10:59.854 --> 00:11:00.809
more data, a lot more

315
00:11:00.809 --> 00:11:02.226
features, a lot more training

316
00:11:02.226 --> 00:11:04.367
examples and later on

317
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.114
after the new regression we'll actually

318
00:11:06.114 --> 00:11:07.832
continue using these linear

319
00:11:07.832 --> 00:11:10.016
algebra tools to derive more

320
00:11:10.016 --> 00:11:13.242
powerful learning algorithims as well
