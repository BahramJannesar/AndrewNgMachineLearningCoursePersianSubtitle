00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.850
Matrix multiplication is really useful,
since you can pack a lot of computation

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.160
into just one matrix
multiplication operation.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.880
But you should be careful
of how you use them.

4
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.046
In this video, I wanna tell you about
a few properties of matrix multiplication.

5
00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:21.157
When working with just real numbers or

6
00:00:21.157 --> 00:00:26.100
when working with scalars,
multiplication is commutative.

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.990
And what I mean by that is
that if you take 3 times 5,

8
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.690
that is equal to 5 times 3.

9
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.390
And the ordering of this
multiplication doesn't matter.

10
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.790
And this is called
the commutative property

11
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.260
of multiplication of real numbers.

12
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.050
It turns out this property,

13
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.410
they can reverse the order in
which you multiply things.

14
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.410
This is not true for
matrix multiplication.

15
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.160
So concretely, if A and B are matrices.

16
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.040
Then in general,
A times B is not equal to B times A.

17
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.240
So, just be careful of that.

18
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.490
Its not okay to arbitrarily reverse
the order in which you multiply matrices.

19
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.090
Matrix multiplication in not commutative,
is the fancy way of saying it.

20
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.996
As a concrete example,
here are two matrices.

21
00:01:10.996 --> 00:01:13.740
This matrix 1 1 0 0 times 0 0 2 0 and

22
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.130
if you multiply these two matrices
you get this result on the right.

23
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.510
Now let's swap around the order
of these two matrices.

24
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.320
So I'm gonna take this two matrices and
just reverse them.

25
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.970
It turns out if you multiply
these two matrices,

26
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.290
you get the second answer on the right.

27
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.500
And well clearly, right, these two
matrices are not equal to each other.

28
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.578
So, in fact, in general if you have
a matrix operation like A times B,

29
00:01:42.578 --> 00:01:47.540
if A is an m by n matrix,

30
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.490
and B is an n by m matrix,
just as an example.

31
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.440
Then, it turns out that
the matrix A times B,

32
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.270
right, is going to be an m by m matrix.

33
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.641
Whereas the matrix B times A is
going to be an n by n matrix.

34
00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:11.302
So the dimensions don't even match, right?

35
00:02:11.302 --> 00:02:16.750
So if A x B and
B x A may not even be the same dimension.

36
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.040
In the example on the left,
I have all two by two matrices.

37
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.870
So the dimensions were the same, but
in general, reversing the order of

38
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.340
the matrices can even change
the dimension of the outcome.

39
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.200
So, matrix multiplication
is not commutative.

40
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.280
Here's the next property
I want to talk about.

41
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.450
So, when talking about real numbers or
scalars, let's say I have 3 x 5 x 2.

42
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.800
I can either multiply 5 x 2 first.

43
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.360
Then I can compute this as 3 x 10.

44
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.660
Or, I can multiply 3 x 5 first,
and I can compute this as 15 x 2.

45
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.140
And both of these give you
the same answer, right?

46
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.630
Both of these is equal to 30.

47
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.775
So it doesn't matter whether
I multiply 5 x 2 first or

48
00:03:07.775 --> 00:03:13.519
whether I multiply 3 x 5 first,
because sort of,

49
00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.080
well, 3 x (5 x 2) = (3 x 5) x 2.

50
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:27.110
And this is called the associative
property of real number multiplication.

51
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.580
It turns out that matrix
multiplication is associative.

52
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.760
So concretely, let's say I have
a product of three matrices A x B x C.

53
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.577
Then, I can compute this
either as A x (B x C) or

54
00:03:39.577 --> 00:03:43.069
I can computer this as (A x B) x C,

55
00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.180
and these will actually
give me the same answer.

56
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.220
I'm not gonna prove this but
you can just take my word for it I guess.

57
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.000
So just be clear,
what I mean by these two cases.

58
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.550
Let's look at the first one, right.

59
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.360
This first case.

60
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.800
What I mean by that is if you
actually wanna compute A x B x C.

61
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.170
What you can do is you
can first compute B x C.

62
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.940
So that D = B x C then compute A x D.

63
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.460
And so
this here is really computing A x B x C.

64
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.980
Or, for this second case,
you can compute this as,

65
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.460
you can set E = A x B,
then compute E times C.

66
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:27.130
And this is then the same as A x B x C,
and it turns out that

67
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.750
both of these options will give you this
guarantee to give you the same answer.

68
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.670
And so we say that matrix multiplication
thus enjoy the associative property.

69
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.150
Okay?

70
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.210
And don't worry about the terminology
associative and commutative.

71
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.100
That's what it's called, but I'm not
really going to use this terminology later

72
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.900
in this class, so
don't worry about memorizing those terms.

73
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.750
Finally, I want to tell you
about the Identity Matrix,

74
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.690
which is a special matrix.

75
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.750
So let's again make the analogy
to what we know of real numbers.

76
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.410
When dealing with real numbers or
scalar numbers, the number 1,

77
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.910
you can think of it as
the identity of multiplication.

78
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.479
And what I mean by that is that for

79
00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.550
any number z, 1 x z = z x 1.

80
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.730
And that's just equal to the number z for
any real number z.

81
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.230
So 1 is the identity operation and
so it satisfies this equation.

82
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.640
So it turns out,
that this in the space of matrices there's

83
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.610
an identity matrix as well and
it's usually denoted I or

84
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.110
sometimes we write it as I of n x n if we
want to make it explicit to dimensions.

85
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.820
So I subscript n x n is
the n x n identity matrix.

86
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.850
And so that's a different identity
matrix for each dimension n.

87
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.470
And here are few examples.

88
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.776
Here's the 2 x 2 identity matrix,
here's the 3 x 3 identity matrix,

89
00:05:57.776 --> 00:05:59.880
here's the 4 x 4 matrix.

90
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.600
So the identity matrix has the property
that it has ones along the diagonals.

91
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.807
All right, and so on.

92
00:06:09.807 --> 00:06:12.810
And 0 everywhere else.

93
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.170
And so, by the way, the 1 x 1
identity matrix is just a number 1,

94
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.850
and so the 1 x 1 matrix with just 1 in it.

95
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.910
So it's not a very
interesting identity matrix.

96
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.120
And informally, when I or
others are being sloppy,

97
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.940
very often we'll write the identity
matrices in fine notation.

98
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.900
We'll draw square brackets, just write
one one one dot dot dot dot one, and

99
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.775
then we'll maybe somewhat sloppily
write a bunch of zeros there.

100
00:06:37.775 --> 00:06:42.520
And these zeroes on the,
this big zero and this big zero,

101
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.710
that's meant to denote that this matrix is
zero everywhere except for the diagonal.

102
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.640
So this is just how I might swap
you the right D identity matrix.

103
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.180
And it turns out that the identity
matrix has its property that for

104
00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.180
any matrix A, A times identity
equals I times A equals A so

105
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.720
that's a lot like this
equation that we have up here.

106
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.650
Right?

107
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.840
So 1 times z equals z
times 1 equals z itself.

108
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.290
So I times A equals A times I equals A.

109
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.940
Just to make sure we have
the dimensions right.

110
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.420
So if A is an m by n matrix,

111
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.160
then this identity matrix here,
that's an n by n identity matrix.

112
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.840
And if is and by then,
then this identity matrix, right?

113
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.560
For matrix multiplication to make sense,
that has to be an m by m matrix.

114
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.900
Because this m has the match up that m,
and in either case,

115
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.860
the outcome of this process is you get
back the matrix A which is m by n.

116
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.890
So whenever we write
the identity matrix I, you know,

117
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:52.355
very often the dimension Mention, right,
will be implicit from the content.

118
00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:55.535
So these two I's, they're actually
different dimension matrices.

119
00:07:55.535 --> 00:07:58.425
One may be n by n, the other is n by m.

120
00:07:58.425 --> 00:08:02.465
But when we want to make the dimension
of the matrix explicit, then

121
00:08:02.465 --> 00:08:06.605
sometimes we'll write to this I subscript
n by n, kind of like we had up here.

122
00:08:06.605 --> 00:08:08.655
But very often,
the dimension will be implicit.

123
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:15.858
Finally, I just wanna
point out that earlier

124
00:08:15.858 --> 00:08:21.928
I said that AB is not,
in general, equal to BA.

125
00:08:21.928 --> 00:08:23.280
Right?

126
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.830
For most matrices A and
B, this is not true.

127
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.640
But when B is the identity matrix,
this does hold true,

128
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.830
that A times the identity matrix
does indeed equal to identity

129
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.280
times A is just that you know this is not
true for other matrices B in general.

130
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:44.260
So, that's it for the properties
of matrix multiplication and

131
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.630
special matrices like the identity
matrix I want to tell you about.

132
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.820
In the next and
final video on our linear algebra review,

133
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:57.750
I'm going to quickly tell you about
a couple of special matrix operations and

134
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.389
after that everything you need to know
about linear algebra for this class.
