00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.850
Let's get started with our linear algebra review.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.850
In this video I want to

3
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.210
tell you what are matrices and what are vectors.

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.770
A matrix is a

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.590
rectangular array of numbers

6
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.810
written between square brackets.

7
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.250
So, for example, here is a

8
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.180
matrix on the right, a left square bracket.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.660
And then, write in a bunch of numbers.

10
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.100
These could be features from

11
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.660
a learning problem or it could

12
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.740
be data from somewhere else, but

13
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.900
the specific values don't matter,

14
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.470
and then I'm going to close it with another right bracket on the right.

15
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.440
And so that's one matrix.

16
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.520
And, here's another example of

17
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.360
the matrix, let's write 3, 4, 5,6.

18
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.020
So matrix is just another

19
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.630
way for saying, is a

20
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.540
2D or a two dimensional array.

21
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.920
And the other piece

22
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.320
of knowledge that we need is

23
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.740
that the dimension of the

24
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.980
matrix is going to

25
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.070
be written as the

26
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.750
number of row times the number of columns in the matrix.

27
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.190
So, concretely, this example

28
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.700
on the left, this

29
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.000
has 1, 2, 3, 4

30
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.370
rows and has 2 columns,

31
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.950
and so this example on the

32
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.850
left is a 4 by

33
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.320
2 matrix -  number of rows by number of columns.

34
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.380
So, four rows, two columns.

35
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.740
This one on the right, this matrix has two rows.

36
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.790
That's the first row, that's

37
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.580
the second row, and it has three columns.

38
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.890
That's the first column, that's the

39
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.350
second column, that's the third

40
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.340
column So, this second

41
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.800
matrix we say it is

42
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.660
a 2 by 3 matrix.

43
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.230
So we say that the dimension of this matrix is 2 by 3.

44
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.690
Sometimes you also see this

45
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.480
written out, in the case

46
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.510
of left, you will see this

47
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.360
written out as R4 by 2

48
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.090
or concretely what people

49
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.280
will sometimes say this matrix

50
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.840
is an element of the set R 4 by 2.

51
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.270
So, this thing here, this

52
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.180
just means the set of all

53
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.020
matrices that of dimension

54
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.960
4 by 2 and this thing

55
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.650
on the right, sometimes this is

56
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.800
written out as a matrix that is an R 2 by 3.

57
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.080
So if you ever see, 2 by 3.

58
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.460
So if you ever see

59
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.700
something like this are 4 by

60
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.960
2 or are 2 by 3,

61
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.450
people are just referring to

62
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.830
matrices of a specific dimension.

63
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.240
Next, let's talk about how

64
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.370
to refer to specific elements of the matrix.

65
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.850
And by matrix elements, other than

66
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.090
the matrix I just mean

67
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.930
the entries, so the numbers inside the matrix.

68
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.270
So, in the standard notation,

69
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.110
if A is this

70
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.860
matrix here, then A sub-strip

71
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.050
IJ is going to refer

72
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.060
to the i, j entry,

73
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.490
meaning the entry in

74
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.690
the matrix in the ith row and jth column.

75
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.200
So for example a1-1 is

76
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.660
going to refer to the entry

77
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.510
in the 1st row and

78
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.900
the 1st column, so that's the

79
00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.720
first row and the first

80
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.600
column and so a1-1

81
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.920
is going to be equal to

82
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.880
1, 4, 0, 2.

83
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.620
Another example, 8 1

84
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.020
2 is going to refer to

85
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.160
the entry in the first

86
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.860
row and the second

87
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.170
column and so A

88
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.000
1 2 is going to be equal to one nine one.

89
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.190
This come from a quick examples.

90
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.360
Let's see, A, oh let's

91
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.970
say A 3 2, is going to refer

92
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.240
to the entry in the 3rd

93
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.340
row, and second column,

94
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.030
right, because that's 3 2

95
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.270
so that's equal to 1 4 3 7.

96
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.480
And finally, 8 4 1

97
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.540
is going to refer to

98
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.320
this one right, fourth row,

99
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.220
first column is equal to

100
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.150
1 4 7 and if,

101
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:54.600
hopefully you won't, but if

102
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.560
you were to write and say

103
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.540
well this A 4

104
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.200
3, well, that refers to

105
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.130
the fourth row, and the

106
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.730
third column that, you know,

107
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.940
this matrix has no third

108
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.420
column so this is undefined,

109
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.280
you know, or you can think of this as an error.

110
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.720
There's no such element as

111
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.540
8 4 3, so, you know, you

112
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.500
shouldn't be referring to 8 4 3.

113
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.120
So, the matrix

114
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.070
gets you a way of letting

115
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.280
you quickly organize, index and access lots of data.

116
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.200
In case I seem to be

117
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.140
tossing up a lot of

118
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.110
concepts, a lot of new notations

119
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.920
very rapidly, you don't need

120
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.230
to memorize all of this, but

121
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.500
on the course website where we

122
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.340
have posted the lecture notes,

123
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.960
we also have all of these definitions written down.

124
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.740
So you can always refer back,

125
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.200
you know, either to these slides,

126
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.950
possible coursework, so audible lecture

127
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.060
notes if you forget well, A41 was that?

128
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.320
Which row, which column was that?

129
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.160
Don't worry about memorizing everything now.

130
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.960
You can always refer back to

131
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.590
the written materials on the course website, and use that as a reference.

132
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.740
So that's what a matrix is.

133
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.000
Next, let's talk about what is a vector.

134
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.400
A vector turns out to be a special case of a matrix.

135
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.170
A vector is a matrix

136
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.590
that has only 1 column so

137
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.650
you have an N x 1

138
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.330
matrix, then that's a remember, right?

139
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.970
N is the number of

140
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.750
rows, and 1 here

141
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.540
is the number of columns, so, so

142
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.760
matrix with just one column

143
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.730
is what we call a vector.

144
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.950
So here's an example

145
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.800
of a vector, with I

146
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.700
guess I have N equals four elements here.

147
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.090
so we also call this

148
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.560
thing, another term for

149
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.300
this is a four dmensional

150
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.410
vector, just means that

151
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.410
this is a vector with four

152
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.400
elements, with four numbers in it.

153
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.130
And, just as earlier

154
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.520
for matrices you saw this

155
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.960
notation R3 by 2

156
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.340
to refer to 2 by

157
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.770
3 matrices, for this vector

158
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.340
we are going to refer to this

159
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.270
as a vector in the set R4.

160
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.900
So this R4 means a

161
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.480
set of four-dimensional vectors.

162
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.230
Next let's talk about how to refer to the elements of the vector.

163
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.970
We are going to use the notation

164
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.030
yi to refer to

165
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.620
the ith element of the

166
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.650
vector y. So if y

167
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.470
is this vector, y subscript i is the ith element.

168
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.080
So y1 is the

169
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.320
first element,four sixty, y2

170
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.670
is equal to the second element,

171
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.030
two thirty two -there's the first.

172
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.780
There's the second.

173
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.840
Y3 is equal to

174
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.380
315 and so on, and

175
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.240
only y1 through y4 are

176
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.600
defined consistency 4-dimensional vector.

177
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.990
Also it turns out that

178
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.950
there are actually 2 conventions

179
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.590
for how to index into a

180
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.250
vector and here they are.

181
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.020
Sometimes, people will use

182
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.820
one index and sometimes zero index factors.

183
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:45.620
So this example on the left

184
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.980
is a one in that

185
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.240
specter where the element

186
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.870
we write is y1, y2, y3, y4.

187
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.710
And this example in the right

188
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.340
is an example of a zero index

189
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.380
factor where we start

190
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.460
the indexing of the elements from zero.

191
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.620
So the elements go from a zero up to y three.

192
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.170
And this is a bit like the

193
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.780
arrays of some primary languages

194
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.080
where the arrays can either

195
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.740
be indexed starting from one.

196
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.390
The first element of an

197
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.590
array is sometimes a Y1,

198
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.480
this is sequence notation I guess,

199
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.580
and sometimes it's zero index

200
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.860
depending on what programming language you use.

201
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.000
So it turns out that in

202
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.680
most of math, the one

203
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.390
index version is more

204
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.150
common For a lot

205
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.640
of machine learning applications, zero index

206
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.400
vectors gives us a more convenient notation.

207
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:37.650
So what you should usually

208
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.580
do is, unless otherwised specified,

209
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.070
you should assume we are using one index vectors.

210
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.750
In fact, throughout the rest

211
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.380
of these videos on linear algebra

212
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.190
review, I will be using one index vectors.

213
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.170
But just be aware that

214
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.150
when we are talking about machine learning

215
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.980
applications, sometimes I will

216
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.340
explicitly say when we

217
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.640
need to switch to, when we

218
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:57.760
need to use the zero index

219
00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.280
vectors as well.

220
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.470
Finally, by convention, usually

221
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.470
when writing matrices and vectors,

222
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.710
most people will use upper

223
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.450
case to refer to matrices.

224
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.750
So we're going to use

225
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.030
capital letters like

226
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.840
A, B, C, you know,

227
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.370
X, to refer to matrices,

228
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.910
and usually we'll use lowercase,

229
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.630
like a, b, x, y,

230
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.460
to refer to either numbers,

231
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.400
or just raw numbers or scalars or to vectors.

232
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.860
This isn't always true but

233
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.210
this is the more common

234
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.610
notation where we use

235
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.870
lower case "Y" for referring

236
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.360
to vector and we usually

237
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.460
use upper case to refer to a matrix.

238
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.820
So, you now know what are matrices and vectors.

239
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.310
Next, we'll talk about some

240
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.330
of the things you can do with them
