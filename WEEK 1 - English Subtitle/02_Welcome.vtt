00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.262
Welcome to this free online class on
machine learning. Machine learning is one

2
00:00:04.262 --> 00:00:08.579
of the most exciting recent technologies.
And in this class, you learn about the

3
00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:13.115
state of the art and also gain practice
implementing and deploying these algorithms

4
00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:17.487
yourself. You've probably use a learning
algorithm dozens of times a day without

5
00:00:17.487 --> 00:00:21.422
knowing it. Every time you use a web
search engine like Google or Bing to

6
00:00:21.422 --> 00:00:25.794
search the internet, one of the reasons
that works so well is because a learning

7
00:00:25.794 --> 00:00:30.002
algorithm, one implemented by Google or
Microsoft, has learned how to rank web

8
00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:35.144
pages. Every time you use Facebook or
Apple's photo typing application and it

9
00:00:35.144 --> 00:00:40.595
recognizes your friends' photos, that's
also machine learning. Every time you read

10
00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:46.054
your email and your spam filter saves you
from having to wade through tons of spam

11
00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:50.980
email, that's also a learning algorithm.
For me one of the reasons I'm excited is

12
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.643
the AI dream of someday building machines
as intelligent as you or me. We're a long

13
00:00:55.643 --> 00:01:00.076
way away from that goal, but many AI
researchers believe that the best way to

14
00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:04.567
towards that goal is through learning
algorithms that try to mimic how the human

15
00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:08.994
brain learns. I'll tell you a little bit
about that too in this class. In this

16
00:01:08.994 --> 00:01:13.542
class you learn about state-of-the-art
machine learning algorithms. But it turns

17
00:01:13.542 --> 00:01:17.919
out just knowing the algorithms and
knowing the math isn't that much good if

18
00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:22.466
you don't also know how to actually get
this stuff to work on problems that you

19
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:26.844
care about. So, we've also spent a lot
of time developing exercises for you to

20
00:01:26.844 --> 00:01:32.088
implement each of these algorithms and
see how they work fot yourself. So why is

21
00:01:32.088 --> 00:01:37.075
machine learning so prevalent today?
It turns out that machine learning is a

22
00:01:37.075 --> 00:01:41.713
field that had grown out of the field of
AI, or artificial intelligence. We wanted

23
00:01:41.713 --> 00:01:46.642
to build intelligent machines and it turns
out that there are a few basic things that

24
00:01:46.642 --> 00:01:51.454
we could program a machine to do such as
how to find the shortest path from A to B.

25
00:01:51.454 --> 00:01:56.267
But for the most part we just did not know
how to write AI programs to do the more

26
00:01:56.267 --> 00:02:00.905
interesting things such as web search or
photo tagging or email anti-spam. There

27
00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:05.718
was a realization that the only way to do
these things was to have a machine learn

28
00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:11.237
to do it by itself. So, machine learning
was developed as a new capability for

29
00:02:11.237 --> 00:02:16.950
computers and today it touches many
segments of industry and basic science.

30
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.496
For me, I work on machine learning and
in a typical week I might end up talking to

31
00:02:21.496 --> 00:02:25.698
helicopter pilots, biologists, a bunch
of computer systems people (so my

32
00:02:25.698 --> 00:02:30.590
colleagues here at Stanford) and averaging
two or three times a week I get email from

33
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.021
people in industry from Silicon Valley
contacting me who have an interest in

34
00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:39.741
applying learning algorithms to their own
problems. This is a sign of the range of

35
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:44.000
problems that machine learning touches.
There is autonomous robotics, computational

36
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.777
biology, tons of things in Silicon Valley
that machine learning is having an impact

37
00:02:48.777 --> 00:02:55.320
on. Here are some other examples of
machine learning. There's database mining.

38
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.063
One of the reasons machine learning has so
pervaded is the growth of the web and the

39
00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:04.751
growth of automation All this means that
we have much larger data sets than ever

40
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:09.272
before. So, for example tons of Silicon
Valley companies are today collecting web

41
00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:13.737
click data, also called clickstream data,
and are trying to use machine learning

42
00:03:13.737 --> 00:03:18.481
algorithms to mine this data to understand
the users better and to serve the users

43
00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:22.327
better, that's a huge segment of
Silicon Valley right now. Medical

44
00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:27.483
records. With the advent of automation, we
now have electronic medical records, so if

45
00:03:27.483 --> 00:03:32.640
we can turn medical records into medical
knowledge, then we can start to understand

46
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.238
disease better. Computational biology.
With automation again, biologists are

47
00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:41.774
collecting lots of data about gene
sequences, DNA sequences, and so on, and

48
00:03:41.774 --> 00:03:46.931
machines running algorithms are giving us
a much better understanding of the human

49
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:51.376
genome, and what it means to be human.
And in engineering as well, in all fields of

50
00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:55.034
engineering, we have larger and larger,
and larger and larger data sets, that

51
00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:59.249
we're trying to understand using learning
algorithms. A second range of machinery

52
00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:03.440
applications is ones that we cannot
program by hand. So for example, I've

53
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.328
worked on autonomous helicopters for many
years. We just did not know how to write a

54
00:04:08.328 --> 00:04:18.023
computer program to make this helicopter
fly by itself. The only thing that worked

55
00:04:18.023 --> 00:04:35.580
was having a computer learn by itself how
to fly this helicopter. [Helicopter whirling]

56
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.880
Handwriting recognition. It turns out one
of the reasons it's so inexpensive today to

57
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.330
route a piece of mail across the
countries, in the US and internationally,

58
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.899
is that when you write an envelope like
this, it turns out there's a learning

59
00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:56.943
algorithm that has learned how to read your
handwriting so that it can automatically

60
00:04:56.943 --> 00:05:01.749
route this envelope on its way, and so it
costs us a few cents to send this thing

61
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:06.318
thousands of miles. And in fact if you've
seen the fields of natural language

62
00:05:06.318 --> 00:05:10.531
processing or computer vision,
these are the fields of AI pertaining to

63
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:15.321
understanding language or understanding
images. Most of natural language processing

64
00:05:15.321 --> 00:05:20.689
and most of computer vision today is
applied machine learning. Learning

65
00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:25.576
algorithms are also widely used for self-
customizing programs. Every time you go to

66
00:05:25.576 --> 00:05:30.286
Amazon or Netflix or iTunes Genius, and it
recommends the movies or products and

67
00:05:30.286 --> 00:05:35.073
music to you, that's a learning algorithm.
If you think about it they have million

68
00:05:35.073 --> 00:05:39.999
users; there is no way to write a million
different programs for your million users.

69
00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:44.807
The only way to have software give these
customized recommendations is to become

70
00:05:44.807 --> 00:05:49.258
learn by itself to customize itself to
your preferences. Finally learning

71
00:05:49.258 --> 00:05:53.294
algorithms are being used today to
understand human learning and to

72
00:05:53.294 --> 00:05:58.042
understand the brain. We'll talk about
how researches are using this to make

73
00:05:58.042 --> 00:06:03.182
progress towards the big AI dream. A few
months ago, a student showed me an article

74
00:06:03.182 --> 00:06:07.996
on the top twelve IT skills. The skills
that information technology hiring

75
00:06:07.996 --> 00:06:13.006
managers cannot say no to. It was a
slightly older article, but at the top of

76
00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:17.988
this list of the twelve most desirable IT
skills was machine learning. Here at

77
00:06:17.988 --> 00:06:21.793
Stanford, the number of recruiters
that contact me asking if I know any

78
00:06:21.793 --> 00:06:25.920
graduating machine learning students
is far larger than the machine learning

79
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.047
students we graduate each year. So I
think there is a vast, unfulfilled demand

80
00:06:30.047 --> 00:06:34.280
for this skill set, and this is a great time to
be learning about machine learning, and I

81
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.454
hope to teach you a lot about machine
learning in this class. In the next video,

82
00:06:38.454 --> 00:06:42.123
we'll start to give a more formal
definition of what is machine learning.

83
00:06:42.123 --> 00:06:46.044
And we'll begin to talk about the main
types of machine learning problems and

84
00:06:46.044 --> 00:06:49.864
algorithms. You'll pick up some of the
main machine learning terminology, and

85
00:06:49.864 --> 00:06:53.684
start to get a sense of what are the
different algorithms, and when each one

86
00:06:53.684 --> 00:06:54.740
might be appropriate.
